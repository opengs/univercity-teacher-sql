# PostgreSQL Cursors using JDBC

1) Create a new Java project and install PostgreSQL JDBC dependency.
2) Connect to the database from the course and use JDBC to
   a) Find all the books that were published after 2003
   b) Calculate the total number of customers
   c) Find the id and title of all books. Use the cursor for this and return results in a batch of 50.
