  - id
  - first name
  - last name
  - department id (connected to the department)

2. Create new table for departments
3. Create new table for student
4. Create 2-3 departments
5. create 2-3 student and assign department for them
6. Create view wich will ilustrate how much student are assigned to the department at the moment
7. Create index for the student name, so searching students by last name or first name will be fast
